1) Difference Between @Size, @Length, and @Column(length=value)
   @Size and @Length are similar. We can use either annotation to validate the size of a field.
   The former is a Java-standard annotation, while the latter is specific to Hibernate.(These are Validators.)


   @Column, though, is a JPA annotation that we use to control DDL statements.
   We'll use @Column to indicate specific characteristics of the physical database column.
   We'll use the length attribute of the @Column annotation to specify the string-valued column length
   Note that we'll use @Column only to specify table column properties, as it doesn't provide validations.
   ex:  @Column(length = 3)
        private String firstName;
        The resulting column will be generated as a VARCHAR(3), and trying to insert a longer string will result in an SQL error.
